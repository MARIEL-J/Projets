# Projects 
This repo contains several projects. These are concrete applications of multivariate and econometric analysis methods. Three different approaches were used each time: programming without packages, programming with packages and an approach based on the use of AI. Two programming languages ​​were used: R and Python.
- Programming without packages: Here, mathematical algorithms were used to implement the different analysis methods.
- Programming with packages: Using dedicated packages, the different analyzes were carried out.
- Use of AI: This part is essentially based on the use of packages designed based on AI, to carry out the different analyses.
